There's no perfect solution for this inconsistency in Expo's `Linking` API. However, here are some strategies to mitigate the problem:

**1.  Adding a Fallback Mechanism:**
Instead of relying solely on `getInitialURL`, implement a fallback mechanism that attempts to retrieve the URL several times with delays.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

async function handleDeepLink() {
  let initialUrl = null;
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL();
    if (initialUrl !== null) break;
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Wait 1 second
  }
  if (initialUrl == null) {
    console.log('Initial URL is null after multiple attempts.');
  } else {
    // Process the URL
    console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl);
  }
}
```

**2. Using a Different Approach (React Navigation):**
If you're using React Navigation, consider using its built-in deep linking capabilities, which might provide a more robust solution.

**3.  Check Android Manifest (Less Likely):**
Ensure your Android manifest is correctly configured to handle deep links.  While less likely to solve this specific issue, verifying the configuration is good practice.

**4.  Report the bug:**  Report this bug to the Expo team, providing detailed reproduction steps to help them understand the issue better. This approach can improve the API in the long run.
